													Oracle Compute Cloud Service is an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offering that provides flexible and scalable computing, block storage, and networking services on Oracle Cloud. You can now set up and manage your computing and storage workloads in the cloud, on demand, using a self-service portal. You’ll significantly reduce your computing costs and increase your business efficiency and agility. Use Oracle Compute Cloud Service to migrate your on-premises workloads to the cloud and reap the many cloud benefits.

												<h3>Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)</h3>
												<p>
													Finally, a cloud that is designed for your business-critical workloads! You can move your business-critical applications and other workloads into the cloud, while maintaining only the highest level of security, high-availability, flexibility, and control. Using Oracle Compute Cloud Service computing, storage, and networking, you can consume resources on demand. As a result, your Capex and personnel costs go down, and you gain high levels of scale and agility not possible in your on-premises environment.

This distributed firewall operates on a flat network without the need for hard network partitioning. It isn’t restricted by location, and operates across the cloud (that is, regardless of nodes, racks, or sites).</li>

												<p>
													You can get a virtual computing environment provisioned on isolated computing resources. Your computing zones will be completely dedicated to your usage (no other tenants on the hardware), with complete network isolation. Securely connect to your environment in the cloud using the site-to-site VPN feature.
